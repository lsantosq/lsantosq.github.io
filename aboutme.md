Although I don't have the answers to the philosophical questions, here I share a little bit about myself.

_PS.: By the way, I would have taken the red pill_

My name is Lucas Queiroz and I am a Machine Learning/Data Science enthusiast, if I may say._It is too formal, right?_ So, in other words, I enjoy the crazy statistics stuff that has been developed so far, extract all information inside the data, and create awesome applications.

I am from Brazil and, currently, I am living in a cold, but an AWESOME place called Calgary, Canada. I graduated in Chemical Engineering at _Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro_ (UERJ) in Brazil including a one-year experience abroad at the _Purdue University_ in the United States.

Yeah, I beat the Chemical Engineering!! But guess what??? I've returned and now I am getting my **_Master of Engineering in Chemical Engineering_**.

Now, besides learning more about reactions and transfer phenomena, my goal is to **gain knowledge on Machine Learning and Data Science concepts and apply them in my masters**!

Finaly, if you have a passion for soccer, games, machine learning, data science, wine, beer or any other random stuff and would like to have a great conversation, feel free to reach me out using your preferred method at the footer of this website!!
