title: About me
---
Hello! My name is **Lucas Queiroz** and a Brazilian who loves soccer, video games, and science! I am fascinated by artificial intelligence and its applications nowadays. Here, I share more about myself! **Before you go**, if you want to contact me, you can use your preferred way at the footer of this website.

## Education

I finished my BSc. degree in Chemical Engineering at _Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro_ (UERJ) in Brazil, 2017. In 2015, I earned a full scholarship to study for one academic year at Purdue University in the United States. My preferred courses are Statistics, Process Control, and simulation.

Currently, I am a Master's student in Chemical Engineering at the University of Calgary in Canada. I am focusing my studies on statistics and probabilistic, machine learning techniques, and programming languages.

## Work Experience

I have two years of experience working in the Sales department at Lubrizol. I improved my interpersonal and communication skills, which I believe are great assets for my professional career. Among several responsibilities, I analyzed data, elaborated different business reports to the sales team, and developed a few tools using Excel-VBA to save time on manual activities.

## Volunteer

In Brazil, I volunteered as a Poll Worker in the elections of 2012,2014, and 2016. Besides it required simple activities, I felt great assisting people in voting, maintaining the success of the poll station, and helping the country.

Currently, I am volunteering at the Let's Talk Science community in Calgary, which is committed to develop youth and disseminate knowledge to the community. I am looking forward to helping them with this mission!

## Hobbies

You can say because I am from Brazil, but I do love football - I am not calling it soccer, because as you play with foot and there is a ball, it is football. Also, I enjoy video games and topics about the universe. I like meeting people also, so feel free to contact me if you want to share ideas or chat about some random topic!
