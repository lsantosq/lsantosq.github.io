Here, I share with you several projects where I try to learn more about data science techniques with hands-on experience and have fun at the same time!

* [Modelling the Influence of Weather Conditions on Traffic Accidents Using Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/lsantosq/Modelling-the-Influence-of-Weather-Conditions-on-Traffic-Accidents-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms)
   
   The goal of this model is to help emergency services estimate and optimize resources based on weather conditions and the scope is the city of Calgary. It would help police services make a proactive plan for unit deployment to reduce emergency response times and help the city plan snow clearing services. Several supervised and unsupervised learning models are used such as linear regression, KNN, random forest, DBSCAN, K-means and mean shift. 
   
   The final report, codes and data can be accessed on my GitHub repository.

* [Mobile Price Prediction - SVM and Logistic Regression Comparison](https://lsantosq.github.io/2020-07-10-Mobile-Price-Prediction-SVM-and-Logistic-Regression/)

    It was a quick project where I analyze the differences between SVM and logistic regression as classifier. The objective is to predict the class of mobile selling price based on its features. It is intended to help businesses when it is time to sell their products.
