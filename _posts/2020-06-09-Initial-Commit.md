Hey all !

As the first post of my blog, I would like to introduce myself. 

My name is Lucas and I created this blog to share with you ideas about Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. My goal is to public statistical analysis I perform using random data and how I think around them. Also, in the future, I would like to bring some scientific articles to discuss about it and make them easier using simple words.

Ohh, I almost forget it! I will share several projects on my portfolio as well.

>**So, stayed tuned!**
