Welcome!

As the first post of my blog, I would like to introduce myself. 

My name is Lucas and I created this blog to share with you ideas about Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. My goal is to public statistical analysis I perform using random data and how I think around them.

Ohh, I almost forget it! I will share some of my projects as well.
